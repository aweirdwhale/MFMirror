Don't have any friends? Better than a curly: MFMirror!

MFMirror is an artificial intelligence based on ChatGPT, created by the Biquettes. It powers the world's best mirror. You might ask: If I had to sum up MFMirror with you today, I'd start by saying that it's a meeting between two brilliant minds who reached out to each other, perhaps at a time when we couldn't take it anymore, when we were alone at home. And it's quite curious to think that this chance meeting forged a most perfect mirror, because when you have this taste for things well done, the beautiful gesture, well I'd say that you don't find the interest in spying on your customers as our competitors Amazon, Google or even Apple do.

So, as you may have gathered, Les Biquettes today present a project born of a meeting between the most eminent minds in science fiction and those of the Brothers Grimm.

A seemingly simple object of fascination, the mirror is in fact a marvellous instrument that has captivated people's imaginations for centuries, possessing a mystical aura that is both practical and magical, making it unique among everyday objects. Here's to artificial intelligence, which we've been talking about far too much lately.

MFMirror is a mirror prototype based on the AI concept of the famous fictional character Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man, or Gideon, the AI of Barry Allen, a.k.a. Flash. A generative AI based on chatGPT, coupled with voice synthesis, will provide a companion, and control home automation without fear of data leakage. Facial recognition will give the user a feeling of proximity. With no keyboard, mouse or other peripherals, the mirror could be controlled by voice or hand gestures. It would display what you ask it to, thanks to a retrieval screen; it would be battery-powered and in standby it would display the time, the weather and could manage your music from the Internet or stored locally. Finally, using proprietary software, it could manage your schedule, timer and much more without using third-party services. The camera would not be connected to the Internet at all, to avoid spyware.


Les Biquettes make it a point of honour to keep your personal information secure (really!), and 99% of the information needed for the device to function properly would be stored locally, safe from rogue advertisers and pirates.
